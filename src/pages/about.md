Hello World! My name is Martin Matanovic.

I am a Berlin-based C# .NET Software Developer from the Black Forest in Germany.

I have a degree in Computer Science from the [Furtwangen University](https://www.hs-furtwangen.de/en/) and more than a decade's work experience.

I work as a full stack developer and build Windows services as well as desktop and web applications.
